*Figure 1: This 2023–2025 timeline illustrates the transition from the saturated "red ocean" of single/multi-agent systems to the underexplored "blue ocean" of the IoA. Early IoA initiatives, nascent protocols(MCP,A2A), and the Agentic AI Foundation established by the Linux Foundation collectively cement IoA as a high-potential frontier for collaborative agent ecosystems.*
